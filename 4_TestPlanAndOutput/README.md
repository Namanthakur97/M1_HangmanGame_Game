# Testing/Evaluation Plan

For this particular game, there will not be any specific test case except that, I will have to check whether the code works correctly or not for the words which are to be guessed. Also, by giving wrong letters more than the number of chances, the user is declared the loser.

**For example:-**
Word: _ A N _ _ A N Guess: H Misses: 	e,i,o,s,t 
Word: H A N _ _ A N Guess: R Misses: e,i,o,s,t 
Word: H A N _ _ A N Guess: N/A Misses: e,i,o,r,s,t 

After all the chances that youâ€™ve guessed wrong you will get a message:

**Oops! The word was HANGMAN.**
